# Task: Refine Markdown File

Your task is to refine a Markdown file by performing the following actions:

1. **Line Length Adjustment**:
   - Ensure all lines in the Markdown file are no longer than **80 characters**.
   - Maintain the original indentation and formatting of the file, such as nested lists, block quotes, and code blocks.
   - If a paragraph or text block exceeds the line limit:
     - Break it into smaller lines, ensuring that each line fits within the 80-character limit.
     - Preserve structure, readability, and proper Markdown syntax.

2. **Ordered List Prefix Check**:
   - Inspect ordered lists to ensure correct numbering sequence:
     - If an ordered list starts with a number other than `1`, reset the sequence to start at `1`.
     - Ensure the correct continuation of numbering for subsequent items (e.g., `1, 2, 3`).
   - Retain proper Markdown formatting, including correct indentation for nested lists.

3. **Preserve Other Formats**:
   - Leave inline formatting (e.g., **bold**, *italics*, `inline code`) unchanged.
   - Ensure block elements such as code blocks, tables, links, images, and block quotes retain their original structure.

4. **Output**:
   - Return the refined Markdown file with all adjustments made.
   - Place the refined content inside a Markdown code block.
