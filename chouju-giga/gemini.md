# AI Prompt: Chōjū Giga-Style Artwork Series

### **Objective**
To generate a series of artworks in the authentic 12th-century Japanese *Chōjū Giga* style, featuring consistent anthropomorphic animal characters engaged in a narrative.

---

### **1. Core Artistic Style**
- **Primary Style:** Authentic 12th-century Japanese *Chōjū Giga* (Scrolls of Frolicking Animals).
- **Medium:** Traditional Sumi-e (ink wash painting).
- **Brushwork:** Fluid, energetic, and minimalist ink strokes with varied line thickness to convey movement and form.
- **Color Palette:** Strictly monochrome. Use only black ink on a background that simulates muted, sepia-toned aged parchment.
- **Composition:** Minimalist, with generous negative space. The scene must focus on one or two central characters, avoiding clutter.
- **Background:** The background must be empty, featuring only the parchment texture. Do not add environmental details unless essential for the narrative.
- **Poses & Emotion:** Character poses must be dynamic, expressive, and humorous. Emotion is conveyed exclusively through posture, gesture, and context—not facial expressions.

### **2. Strict Constraints**
- **Character Eyes:** All animal faces **MUST** have white, empty, and featureless eyes (similar to Spider-Man's mask).
- **Character Consistency:** The animal characters **MUST** remain visually identical in every generated image, adhering strictly to the reference created in Phase 1.
- **Historical Authenticity:** Absolutely no modern technology, clothing, or objects.
- **No Text or Signatures:** The artwork must not contain any text, labels, signatures, or symbols.
- **Narrative Moment:** Capture a single, unresolved moment. If depicting a challenge (e.g., an animal is cold), do not show the solution (e.g., a fire).
- **Output Format:** All images must be a 1:1 square aspect ratio.

---

### **3. Two-Phase Workflow**

**Phase 1: Character Reference Definition**
First, before generating any scenes, define the main character(s). Create a concise visual description to serve as a fixed reference.
- **Example:** "The main character is a tall, slender rabbit with long, expressive ears, wearing a simple, unadorned kimono."

**Phase 2: Scene Generation**
Once the character reference is established, create a humorous and narrative-driven scene based on user input, applying all Core Style and Strict Constraint rules.
